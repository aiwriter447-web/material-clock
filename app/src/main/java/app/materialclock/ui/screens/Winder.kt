/**
 * A spring-wound timer's dial: the disc seen **edge-on**, wearing M3 Expressive's slider anatomy.
 *
 * ## The drum
 *
 * A stepped slider was the wrong shape for this. A pomodoro timer is a knurled wheel you turn, and
 * what sells a wheel on a flat screen is perspective: graduations sit at equal angles *around* a
 * cylinder and are then projected, `x = centre + R·sin θ`, which bunches them toward the rim the
 * way a real drum's do. Depth is `cos θ`, and it drives **width and brightness**: the graduation
 * under the handle is thickest and brightest, and the rest thin and dim until they cross the
 * silhouette at ±90°. Height stays constant across the whole face: shortening them with distance
 * as well was tried and read as a ruler with a curve drawn on it.
 *
 * ## Why it now looks like Material
 *
 * The first version was a bespoke drawing that happened to sit in a Material app. This one borrows
 * the expressive **slider's** anatomy, measured off the concept's own audio player. The drum body
 * *is* the track, in `surfaceContainerHighest`, at an 18 dp radius rather than a full capsule,
 * because a capsule reads as a pill and this is meant to read as a drum.
 *
 * There is no separate handle. The graduation passing under the centre *becomes* the marker and
 * hands the role back as it leaves, so nothing appears or disappears.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "wound so far" fill. It was tried and it read as a separate chip stuck
 * to the left end: a drum's position is shown by which graduation is under the handle, not by how
 * much of a track is coloured.
 *
 * ## Snap and smoothness
 *
 * The drag accumulates in a float and the drawing follows that float, not the rounded value. The
 * earlier version snapped, and the cause was its own re-sync: it reset `pos` from the incoming
 * `value` whenever the two drifted by more than three-quarters of a unit, which during a drag is
 * constantly. Every emitted step therefore yanked the drum back onto a whole number. Now an
 * incoming value this control just emitted is recognised as its own echo and ignored; only a
 * genuinely external change re-seats the drum.
