 * The stopwatch.
 *
 * Extrapolated: the concept set contains no stopwatch at all, so this reuses the timer's own
 * vocabulary (the stacked hollow digits, the wide pills) rather than importing a different look.
 * The bottom pair of digits is hundredths, which is why the whole screen is driven off a
 * frame-paced ticker instead of a one-second one.
 *
 * The fastest and slowest laps are marked in tertiary and error. That is not in the renders; it is
 * the one addition, on the grounds that a lap list nobody can compare is just a receipt.

/**
 * The controls: **one row, one height, two states, and a morph between them.**
 *
 * Untouched, the screen offers only Start. Lap and Reset have nothing to act on yet, and a live
 * control that does nothing is worse than an absent one. It is sized to its own label, because a
 * lone button that spans the screen claims an importance the row does not have once it splits.
 *
 * Pressing it runs two phases, in order, and the order is the effect:
 *
 *  1. **Expand.** The pill grows from its content width to the full row on the expressive spatial
 *     spring. Its shape is already fully round, so growing the width *is* the morph; a small pill
 *     becomes a wide one with no corner interpolation to get wrong.
 *  2. **Split.** Only once it has arrived does the three-button row cross-fade in, with its 6 dp
 *     gaps opening from nothing. So the wide pill is seen to divide rather than to be replaced.
 *
 * The delay on phase 2 is what sequences them; running both on one curve reads as a dissolve.
 *
 * Both states are exactly [ROW_HEIGHT], and that is the whole point. An earlier version graded the
 * button heights down as laps accumulated to buy list space, which worked and looked wrong: the
 * controls twitched under the thumb on every lap press, and the band left for laps changed four
 * times. Fixing the height instead means nothing below the readout ever moves, and it makes the lap
 * band a constant, the same on a fresh screen as on a full one.
