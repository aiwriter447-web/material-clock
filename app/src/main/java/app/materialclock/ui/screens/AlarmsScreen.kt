/**
 * The alarm grid.
 *
 * Proportions are measured off the research-concept renders in `clock-mockups/reference/concept/`.
 * At 412 dp wide the render gives a tile of 184 × 250 dp on a 15.7 dp margin with a 12 dp gutter,
 * a 23.9 dp corner radius, and an hour numeral whose cap height is 153 dp: **0.62 of the tile**.
 * That figure is the design; it is what makes the grid read as a wall of numerals rather than a
 * list of cards with big text on them.
 *
 * Armed and disarmed differ by **weight, not by fill**: `wght` 260 against `wght` 120 on the same
 * ultra-condensed cut, solved from the render's measured stem-over-cap of 0.0639 and 0.0306. The
 * off state is a light numeral, not an outlined one.
 *
 * Every element of the time (hour, minutes, meridiem) carries the *same* tracking. See
 * [ClockFace.CONDENSED_TRACKING] for why that is one constant rather than solved per element.

/**
 * The one cap height every tile in the grid is set at.
 *
 * Everything here is linear in the cap. The numerals are ink-tight, the gap is a fraction of the
 * cap and the meridiem is a fraction of the cap, so one measurement at a reference size gives the
 * constant of proportionality and the answer is a division.
 *
 * ## Why this takes no arguments about *this* tile
 *
 * It used to. It solved the cap per tile from that tile's own **ink**, and returned a per-tile
 * shift that centred that ink. Both were wrong, and together they were the whole bug:
 *
 *  - **Ink varies with the digits.** At `wdth` 25 a four-digit time spans 0.645 em (`11:15`) to
 *    0.820 em (`06:40`) in proportional figures. On a 174 dp tile that is a 45 dp swing in the
 *    block's width.
 *  - **The ceiling always won.** Solved over all 720 times, the width fit *never* came in under
 *    the old `0.62 * tileHeight` ceiling. The cap was therefore always the ceiling, the fit never
 *    bound, and every one of those 45 dp went into slack instead of into the numeral.
 *  - **The shift then split that slack.** `06:40` filled the tile and sat on a 12.7 dp margin;
 *    `07:15` was 35 dp narrower and sat on a 22.5 dp one. Two tiles side by side, ten dp apart,
 *    for no reason a reader could see.
 *
 * The fix is upstream of all three: with tabular figures every time is the same number of identical
 * cells, so there is exactly one answer and it is the same for every tile. This function computes
 * it from `"00"` at [ClockFace.WEIGHT_ON], never from the tile's own time or weight, precisely so
 * that it cannot come out differently anywhere.
 *
 * It still divides by [available], so a wider or narrower tile still gets a cap that fits, and
 * [ceiling] still stops a wide tile growing the numeral down into the switch.
 *
 * The meridiem stays in the max for safety, though tabular minutes are now always the wider of the
 * two: `00` at 0.743 cap is 71.5 dp against `AM`'s 28 dp at 0.145 cap.

/**
 * The repeat days, on the switch's own line.
 *
 * ## One text run, so the spacing is the font's
 *
 * Two earlier attempts gave each letter its own fixed-width box: first every box the same, then
 * each box sized to its own advance. Both are the same mistake in different clothes. A box
 * boundary is a wall the shaper cannot see across, so the side bearings the type designer drew get
 * overridden by an invented cell width and no kerning pair can apply. Equal boxes put 6.9 dp beside
 * `F` and 2.3 dp beside `T`; advance-sized boxes still left slack around every inactive letter,
 * because a light glyph is narrower than the bold cell it was centred in.
 *
 * So all seven are **one** [AnnotatedString], each letter a span carrying its own weight and
 * colour. The text engine then spaces them exactly as the font says to, which is the only
 * definition of "even" that the eye agrees with.
 *
 * ## And the block still cannot change width
 *
 * The switch sits beside this and must land in the same place on every tile, so the run is squeezed
 * to [DAY_BLOCK_DP] by a scale *derived* from its own measured width rather than tuned. A tile with
 * more bold letters squeezes a fraction harder (about 1.5 % between the extremes, some 0.2 dp on
 * a letter), and the block, and so the switch, does not move at all.
 *
 * [DAY_TRACKING_DP] is inside that squeeze, so tightening it hands the space straight to the
 * letters: block width fixed, tracking down, glyphs wider.
