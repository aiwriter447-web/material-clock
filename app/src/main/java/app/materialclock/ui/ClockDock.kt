/**
 * The app's primary navigation: a floating pill with a detached add button, and no navigation bar.
 *
 * Same pattern as Notes' dock, and the same deliberate off-spec choice. The corpus sanctions it in
 * exactly one line (*"Floating toolbars can be used as tabs between related subsequent pages"*),
 * and it is what Google Photos and Google Chat ship. What it buys is the bottom edge: the alarm
 * grid and the world-clock list run full-bleed underneath instead of stopping at a 64 dp bar.
 *
 * **What it costs, and what this file pays.** `FloatingToolbar.kt` contains no `Role.*` and no
 * `selectableGroup()`. A screen reader would announce four unlabelled buttons. The contract that
 * `ShortNavigationBar` gave away free is therefore supplied by hand: the row is a
 * `selectableGroup()`, every destination is `selectable` with `Role.Tab`, and each carries a text
 * label rather than leaning on the icon. If this regresses, it regresses silently.
 *
 * ## Centring
 *
 * The **group** is centred, not the pill. Timers and Stopwatch have nothing to add, so when the
 * add button leaves, the row narrows and the pill glides right into the middle of the screen on
 * its own, with no second layout to maintain. That works only because [PlusButton] animates its
 * *reported width*, not just its drawing; a button that merely faded would leave the pill sitting
 * off-centre beside a hole.

/**
 * The add button, which is only meaningful on two of the four tabs.
 *
 * ## Two speeds, on purpose
 *
 * The glyph goes first and goes fast on a hard 110 ms tween, so the button is empty before it has
 * finished leaving. The container then shrinks on the expressive spatial spring while its corner
 * radius travels from the 22 dp squircle to a full circle, so the last thing on screen is a
 * vanishing dot rather than a shrinking rounded square. Reversed on the way in. Running both on one
 * curve reads as a screenshot being scaled; splitting them is what makes it read as the icon being
 * put away and the container closing after it.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `AnimatedVisibility`
 *
 * A transform does not change a measured size, and neither `scaleOut` nor `shrinkHorizontally`
 * alone gives a container that is simultaneously shrinking, re-cornering, and surrendering layout
 * width at the same rate. The `Layout` here reports `(button + gap) × progress`, which is what lets
 * the pill beside it glide to centre in lockstep instead of jumping when the animation ends.
