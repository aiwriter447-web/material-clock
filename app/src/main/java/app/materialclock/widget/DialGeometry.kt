/**
 * Every proportion on the dial, as a fraction of **Rmin**, the *smallest* distance from the centre
 * to the outline over a full turn.
 *
 * Rmin rather than the widget's half-width is the whole trick for arbitrary shapes: scale the hands
 * off it and a hand can never poke out of a clover, an arrow or a semicircle, whatever direction it
 * points. Numerals riding the outline are free to sit further out in the wide directions, because
 * they are placed from the outline itself rather than from a radius.
 *
 * The hand figures are Google's canonical watch-face geometry (the 450 × 450 Watch Face Format
 * reference dial, `w=20 h=190 pivotY=0.921` for the hour hand and so on), converted to fractions.
 * The pin and cell figures come from `ClockDialSelectorCenterContainerSize` (8/256) and
 * `ClockDialSelectorHandleContainerSize` (48/256) in Material's own time-picker tokens.
