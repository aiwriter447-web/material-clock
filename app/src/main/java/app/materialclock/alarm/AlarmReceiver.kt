/**
 * The alarm going off, and everything that can invalidate a schedule.
 *
 * ## Why one receiver for four unrelated broadcasts
 *
 * Boot, "user changed the clock", "user changed time zone" and "we just updated the app" all mean
 * the same thing to this app. Every `AlarmManager` entry it owns is now either gone or wrong, so
 * re-derive them from the stored alarms. `AlarmManager` keeps nothing across a reboot, and an
 * alarm set for 07:00 in Montréal must still be 07:00 after landing in Paris, which means the
 * absolute instant has to be recomputed rather than preserved.
 *
 * `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` is the one people forget: installing a new build tears down the old
 * process's alarms, and without it every debug install silently disarms the user's clock.
 *
 * ## goAsync
 *
 * Reading DataStore suspends and `onReceive` runs on the main thread with a hard deadline. The
 * pending result keeps the process alive across the coroutine; `finish()` must be reached on every
 * path or the receiver leaks and the system eventually kills the app for it.
