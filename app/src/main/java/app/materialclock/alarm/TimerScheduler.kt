/**
 * Keeps the timer's expiry alarm and its ongoing notification in step with the stored timer.
 *
 * There is one entry point, [sync], and that is deliberate. Start, pause, resume, +1 min and
 * cancel all reduce to "the timer is now *this*, make the world match", and giving each of them
 * its own method is how you end up with a paused timer that still has a live alarm behind it.
 *
 * The alarm is `ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP` because the timer is measured in elapsed time: a user who
 * changes the clock, or crosses a DST boundary, has not shortened their pasta timer.

                // timer started about a minute after the previous one expired never went off at
                // all, silently. Two short timers in a row is not an edge case for a kitchen
                // timer, it is the normal way one gets used.

                // timer that is occasionally silent is not a timer.
